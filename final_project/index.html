    <h2>Intro</h2>
    <h2 style="margin-right: 25px; font-weight: lighter;"> Hi, and welcome to my website! This is my final project for my Web Design class. I am an eighth grader at Eastside Preparatory School in Kirkland, Washington. I love soccer and it is my main activity. I enjoy writing, especially opinion essays. I was born in Dubai, UAE, where I lived for three years, then my family moved to New Zealand, where I stayed for a year, then moved to Bellevue (a part of greater Seattle), which is where I have lived since. I attended Cherry Crest Elementary and now go to Eastside Prep, where I joined in 6th grade. I am one of five kids and am the fourth child. I have two pets, one dog and one cat, and I love them very much. I love reading, some favourite books being The Great Gatsby, Unbroken, Guards! Guards! and Great Expectations, along with many others.  I love LEGO and have shelves dedicated to my sets that decorate my room. I am a patriotic New Zealander and a loyal fan of Liverpool FC. I hope to be a reporter or lawyer when I am older (read more about it). This website is all about me. What classes I like, what interests I have, and more! Please enjoy!
