        <p>This is me earlier this year. Playing soccer I broke my wrist by landing on it funny. I was really happy to get my cast as it was a lot less clunky and bulky than the previous one. I am now fully healed and I hope that I never break anything again.</p>

        <p>This is me and my Dad at Anfield, home of Liverpool. I have supported Liverpool FC since I was little (my dad for much longer) and this was my first time visiting Anfield. We got to watch a game and that was one of the highlights of my life. I got to see some of the players that I have been cheering on for over seven years</p>
