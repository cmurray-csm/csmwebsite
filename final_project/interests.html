      <h2>Soccer</h2>
    <p>I love to play soccer. It is my main activity and I have been playing all my life. I play right winger and have been the top goal scorer for the past few years on my team. I now play at crossfire and am hoping to play in college but that will be a hard challenge. My favorite soccer team is Liverpool FC, an English Premier League team that has just won its twentieth title. I hope to play soccer for my whole life.</p>
    <br>
    <h2>Music</h2>
    <p>I sing and play piano (not very well). I sing in a group called the Northwest Boychoir that performs in Benaroya Hall, and we have performed over thirty songs a season. I really like to sing and really enjoy how my group does it. In college, I think that I will do a acapella (if I can fit it into a college schedule). Throughout middle school it was focused around classical music, but in high school we sing rock and roll through the decades along with the coral stuff. </p>
    <br>
    <h2>Writing</h2>
    <p>I love to write, I think that I want to become a reporter or lawyer, basically because they write a lot of opinion pieces. I love doing those, and I think that doing that as a profession would be interesting. Another thing about being a reporter is that I would be on the front line of news and I would be helping people get information and being able to analyze what people are doing. I also read the news a lot, so maybe being a part of another kid's aspirations would be cool.</p>
