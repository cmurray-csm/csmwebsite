<p>
  <ul>
    <li>Milford Sound</li>
    <li>Arguably the crowning jewel of New Zealand’s great walks, thousands of years of glaciers and rivers have flowed through, creating massive Fiordland. Great mountains jut up through the placid water and tower above, “A place where waterfalls tumble from sheer cliffs and mountains rise straight from the sea — Milford Sound feels like another world entirely.” — Lonely Planet. </li>
    <br>
    <li>Lake Taupō</li>
    <li>The largest lake in New Zealand, Lake Taupō, is the crater left by a super volcano, around 18000 years ago. Its waters are full of fish, especially Rainbow and Brown trout. It is a beautiful area and cool.</li>
    <br>
    <li>Rotorua</li>
    <li>Rotorua is a part of the Taupō volcano, it is extremely active with geysers, mud pools, and more. The Māori used it for cooking their food underground. Using the heat of the Earth to their advantage.</li>
    <br>
    <li>The Coromandel</li>
    <li>The Coromandel is a stretch of coastline known for its pristine beaches and amazing natural landscape. A favorite beach of mine, Wangamata is a large stretch of white sand with an island that you can wade out to on one side, and then an estuary on the other. The Coromandel is home to Cathedral Cove or better known as the microsoft homescreen. Really cool, and I love spending time there. </li>
